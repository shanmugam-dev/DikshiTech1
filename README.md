## Project Structure

- `src/App.jsx` – Main layout that wires all sections.

  - Hover scale / lift on cards and buttons.
- Smooth scrolling is enabled globally via CSS (`scroll-behavior: smooth`) and section IDs.
- Replace placeholder copy, contact email, and social URLs with your real company data before production use.
